git init
git add .
git commit -am "skbidi commit"
git push origin main

copy and paste above code into VScode terminal to commit new stuff!!!(only for projects that have already been linked to github)

for new projects, once folder is created for that project, run these commands after also making github repository 
without any files or anything in it, and name of repository must be same as folder name.
ALL COMMANDS LISTED HERE GO INTO COMMAND PROMPT, NOT VSCODE TERMINAL!!!

cd (path to folder, NOT including C:\Users\espen) example: cd C:\coding things\coursera-test
copy and paste:
echo "# coursera-test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md

coursera-test should be the name of the folder, which should match the name of the github repository name.

then input:
git add .

copy and paste:

git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/monkeman0/coursera-test.git
git push -u origin main

link should be link of the provided link on page, always like this:
https://github.com/(username)/(name of repository).git 
example: https://github.com/monkeman0/coursera-test.git

after pasting another press of enter key is required.
